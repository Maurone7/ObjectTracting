# ObjectTracting

The following code is meant to calculate the drift in a series of pictures and correct it by creating a new series of pictures and saving them in a new folder.

When the code is running, you will have to paste the folder address at the first question. You can also change the code by substituting the input into the address, that will save you some time if you're running the code over and over. You will be then asked what filter to apply to sort out the pictures you're interested in selecting. And then you will have to decide what name the folder, where the new pictures that will be saved, will be.

Pay attention to use the correct code, depending on wheter you're using it on MAC or WINDOWS, the correct code to use it clearly marked as the name of the code.
